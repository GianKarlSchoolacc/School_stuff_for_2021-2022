# Main Target: Sleeping Pattern and continuous sleep 
<br>

**Main Objectives:** to figure out the the causes and effects of sleeping pattern and why it happens to be one of the underrated topics in sleeping

**Other Objectives:** to somehow relate the sleeping pattern to sleeping disorders
- And connecting Circadian rhythm to Quality of sleep

<br>

## I: Connections in finding of articles about Sleeping Patterns and Sleeping disorders

##### 1. Is sleep in general really important to a student in academics

- According to the research in [SCIRP.ORG](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax), Sleep is clearly an important aspect of successful academic and personal life in college, yet very little attention has been given to finding an appropriate sleeping pattern. This study was designed to discover a relationship between a healthy sleeping schedule and academic success in the undergraduates of King Edward Medical University, Lahore so that we may be able to encourage medical students to seek healthier sleep habits, by using academic success as motivation. Students mindful of the importance of healthy sleep patterns may be able to improve their achievements. **"It means that without the treatment for good sleep, it means worse performance in academics and maintaining cleanliness in their own rooms"** i

##### 2. Does sleep patterns really affect their academic demands or more than that?

Well, according to the research in [SCIRP.ORG](https://www.scirp.org/html/8-8302141_39485.htm?pagespeed=noscript). As sleeping pattern is not related to academic performance, we can explore other aspects in the routine of students that may have an effect, like eating habits, exercise, mood and perceived stress [[9](https://www.scirp.org/html/8-8302141_39485.htm?pagespeed=noscript#ref9)]. Poorer academic performance was related significantly to reduction in night time sleep [[10](https://www.scirp.org/html/8-8302141_39485.htm?pagespeed=noscript#ref10)] and later times of waking up in the morning [[11](https://www.scirp.org/html/8-8302141_39485.htm?pagespeed=noscript#ref11)], however no such association was found in our research. Socioeconomic status also effects sleep and academic performance [[12](https://www.scirp.org/html/8-8302141_39485.htm?pagespeed=noscript#ref12)]. Sleep deprivation can cause attention deficits, daytime somnolence, and depressive mood with impaired daytime performance. Most effective counter measure of sleepiness is sleep [13-15].

Medical students are subjected to high levels of stress during their academic year that can lead to psychological problems resulting in sleep disturbances. They have day and night time ward rounds, seminars, presentations, weekly and monthly assessment tests and other extracurricular activities, which they have to complete in a limited period of time. These activities increase the incidence that their actual bedtime will be pushed back. Moreover, students come from different backgrounds in different areas, they have different styles of studying, and different capabilities to cope with routine pressures resulting in different sleeping patterns. Therefore, students having difficulties in their academics should be screened for sleep insufficiency [16-18].

Academic achievements may depend on additional factors. Factor analysis of sleep habits in several groups of subjects have shown that sleep may vary in its characteristics, along with several independent dimensions simultaneously in addition to its quantity [[19](https://www.scirp.org/html/8-8302141_39485.htm?pagespeed=noscript#ref19)]. Thus, failure to demonstrate a relationship between academic performance and amount of sleep obtained is not surprising. Previously it was demonstrated that although some sort of sleep difficulty affected a large number of students as well, its full impact on academic performance has remained unknown. Behavioral interventions, often recommended as important sleep aid, include exercise and alleviating stress and worries have shown promising results [20,21].

Due to the various responsibilities students possess, they cannot go to bed earlier and as a result may obtain insufficient sleep to perform well next day. In a study by Lowry M., sleep deprived students also scored high as they engaged themselves in more positive activities in place of sleep, like studying. This is in accordance with our findings as students who scored higher in professional examinations, were most commonly involved in studying whenever they were up late at night. Meanwhile below average students were mostly busy with extracurricular activities like gossiping, roaming and smoking. Thus, a more dedicated attitude toward studying seems to be significant, rather than the amount of time a student spends sleeping. Prolonged low quality sleep may result in the studentâ€™s inability to cope with academic demands. This was the same case with below average students who reported that their sleep was mostly interrupted by a variety of factors. In most of these cases, waking up from sleep is unpleasant as most students reported developing a headache and finding it difficult to go back to sleep afterwards which may lead to inadequate sleep [22-24].

##### 3. Does disrupting you circadian rhythm worsen the ability to do work at school or at home?

- According to the research in [uclahealth.](https://www.uclahealth.org/sleepcenter/circadian-rhythms), Your circadian system seems to be programmed to a large extent by genetics. Sleep studies show that sleep tends to consist of normal cycles of sleep stages. It also occurs most often in a single block of time at night. Many factors can cause your "circadian orchestra" to be out of tune. The circadian system appears to change as you age. These changes can affect your body's natural rhythm. They also affect your ability to respond to time cues. These changes may cause your body to have a hard time keeping up with the demands of your daily schedule.

- A conflict can also arise when time demands keep you from following your body's sleep signals. This can greatly disrupt your normal sleep pattern. These demands can be related to any of the following:

-   Work
-   School
-   Social commitments

- We are just starting to understand how the circadian system works. As we learn more, we are able to better treat related sleep problems. The following are the most common of these problems.

##### 4. Does improving your timing of sleep is very important in having a good sleeping pattern?

According to the articles in [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170612094045.htm). Students with more regular sleep patterns had better school grades on average. Researchers found no significant difference in average sleep duration between most students with irregular sleep patterns and most regular sleepers.

"We found that the body clock was shifted nearly three hours later in students with irregular schedules as compared to those who slept at more consistent times each night, stated Charles A. Czeisler, PhD, MD, Director of the Sleep Health Institute at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and senior author on the paper. "For the students whose sleep and wake times were inconsistent, classes and exams that were scheduled for 9 a.m. were therefore occurring at 6am according to their body clock, at a time when performance is impaired. Ironically, they didn't save any time because in the end they slept just as much as those on a more regular schedule."
