### Plagiarism and how to avoid it
<br>

-  Do not plagiarize from articles or from other students.
- Be sure to cite your sources in APA format in the text of your paper and in the references.

<br>

- Generally, you should cite a source only once per paragraph (unless you are discussing more than one source in the same paragraph), and it is best to cite the source at or near the beginning of the paragraph.
