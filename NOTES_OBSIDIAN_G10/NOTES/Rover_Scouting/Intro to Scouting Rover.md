- On August 1, 1970, 20 boys gathered together to join the first experimental Scout camp on Brownsea Land. The event was lead by <b>Robert Baden-Powell</b>, a soldier, artist and writer. He hopes to bridge the gap in society and give everyone the opportunity to learn new skills. It was a radical idea at that time, but it paved the way for what was to come.
